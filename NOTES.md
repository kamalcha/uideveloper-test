#Selz - UI Developer Test

[Demo](http://kamalcha.github.io/uideveloper-test/)

##Process
Before I start, first I decided on how I will designing this and what technology I will use.

###Design
I decided that I'm going to use my [Product Box](https://dribbble.com/shots/1722228-Product-Box) Design as inspiration and designing in the browser to make it easier and faster to experiment.

When designing I adopting a user-centric approach to the layout. I use large image for the item image, sit on the left side and put all item details to the right of the image. Based on [eye tracking studies](http://www.nngroup.com/articles/f-shaped-pattern-reading-web-content/), stating the eye starts at the top left and moves left to right suggesting this placement is ideal to provide necessary information.

Title can either sit directly above the image or at the top of the page to the right of the image, on this design I put it at the top of the page with description of the item below. 

Regular and sale price is next, I also added savings percentage as of years of studies have proven the power of showing the savings.

The "buying area" is a section to draw the user's eye making it obvious this is the primary action he/she is meant to take and achieved. Used a strong call to action button, big and colored makes this section obvious.

Here the sketch file in case you need it [link](https://www.dropbox.com/s/yozn8zdloawi1y6/widget.sketch?dl=0)

###Technologies
As for the technology used to create this widget, I use Grunt, Sass, jQuery and plain old HTML. I decided to go with Grunt and Sass because I'm more comfortable and familiar using it also it is faster for me to work using all of those technology for this test.
